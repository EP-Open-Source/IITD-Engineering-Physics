## Entry-level reality check

- Not all roles are available at entry level
- Many industry roles require **specialization**
- Internships are the most common entry point
- Projects matter more than coursework alone

---

## How to use this section

Recommended approach:
1. Identify 1–2 role categories
2. Read the corresponding detailed files
3. Align skills and projects accordingly
4. Revisit as your interests evolve

Avoid trying to prepare for all roles simultaneously.

---

## Final note

The quantum industry is diverse but still emerging.

Choosing a role early helps you **focus preparation**, build relevant projects, and avoid shallow skill accumulation.
