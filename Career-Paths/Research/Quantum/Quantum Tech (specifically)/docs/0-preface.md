# Preface

Quantum Technology is entering a transformative era. With the rise of quantum computing, communication, sensing, and advanced quantum materials, the global scientific and industrial landscape is shifting rapidly. For Engineering Physics students—especially at institutions like IIT Delhi—this field offers a unique opportunity to contribute to one of the greatest technological revolutions of the 21st century.

This guide has been created to serve as a comprehensive roadmap for students who wish to build a meaningful and successful career in Quantum Technology. It consolidates information that is typically scattered across research papers, industry reports, and academic programs, and presents it as a structured, actionable source.

### Why this guide exists
- Students often lack clarity about **research areas**, **industry roles**, and **required skills**.  
- Quantum Technology is vast and interdisciplinary—spanning physics, mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, and materials.  
- There is no single student-friendly resource that connects the fields, shows skill pathways, and provides real career guidance.  
- Undergraduate students often struggle with choosing the right projects, internships, courses, and higher education options.  

This guide aims to fix that.

### What this guide provides
- Deep explanation of major quantum research areas  
- A skill roadmap tailored for undergraduates  
- Year-wise strategy to build a strong quantum profile  
- Industry career paths and job qualifications  
- A curated list of quantum companies worldwide  
- Guidance for internships, research, higher education, and PhD pathways  
- Ready-to-use templates (CV, SOP, research emails)  
- Project ideas and GitHub-ready code structure  
- A clear decision-making framework to help students choose their direction   

### How to use this guide
You don’t need to read it linearly.  
Each section is modular.  
You can jump directly to:
- Skills you need  
- Projects to build  
- Research opportunities  
- Industry job roles  
- PhD and Masters options  
- Quantum companies  

### Our philosophy
Quantum Technology is a long-term journey.  
This guide focuses on **clarity, depth, and career outcomes**, not hype.  

If you are consistent—through projects, learning, and building your profile—you can become a competitive candidate for top research labs and quantum companies around the world.
