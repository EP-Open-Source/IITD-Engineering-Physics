# Resume Guide for Quantum Technology Careers

Your resume is often the first filter in internships, industry roles, and graduate school applications. In Quantum Technology, a strong resume must clearly communicate **technical depth, research exposure, and project quality**—not just grades.

This section explains how to build a resume that works for quantum-focused opportunities.

---

## General resume principles

A good quantum resume should be:
- Clear and concise (1 page for undergraduates)
- Technically precise
- Easy to scan
- Focused on substance over buzzwords

Avoid generic statements that do not show evidence.

---

## Recommended resume structure

1. Header  
2. Education  
3. Skills  
4. Projects  
5. Research / Internships  
6. Achievements / Activities (optional)

Order sections to highlight your strengths.

---

## Education section

Include:
- Degree and institution
- Expected graduation year
- CGPA (only if strong)
- Relevant coursework (quantum, math, CS, electronics)

Do not list every course—be selective.

---

## Skills section

Group skills clearly:
- Programming languages
- Quantum frameworks
- Physics and math areas
- Tools and software

Avoid self-rating scales. Skills must be backed by projects.

---

## Projects section (most important)

Each project should include:
- One-line problem statement
- Tools and techniques used
- What you implemented
- What you learned or achieved

Example format:
- *Implemented a noise-aware VQE algorithm using Qiskit to study small molecular Hamiltonians.*

Quality and clarity matter more than quantity.

---

## Research and internships

Include:
- Lab or organization name
- Advisor or mentor
- Time period
- Specific contributions

Focus on what **you did**, not what the group does.

---

## Achievements and activities

Optional but useful:
- Scholarships or awards
- Conference presentations
- Technical leadership roles
- Relevant competitions

Only include what adds value.

---

## Customizing for different roles

### Industry roles
- Emphasize programming and systems
- Highlight deliverables and results
- Focus on applied projects

### Research / PhD roles
- Emphasize research depth
- Highlight papers, preprints, or reports
- Show intellectual independence

Tailor your resume for each application.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Overcrowding the resume
- Listing skills without evidence
- Using vague descriptions
- Ignoring formatting consistency

A cluttered resume hides strong content.

---

## Formatting guidelines

- Use a clean, professional font
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- No graphics or colors
- PDF format only

Simplicity signals professionalism.

---

## Final note

Your resume should tell a **coherent story**:
where you started, what you built, and where you are heading.

Revisit and refine it regularly as your skills grow.
