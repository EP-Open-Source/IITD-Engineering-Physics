# Quantum Materials

Quantum Materials research focuses on discovering, understanding, and engineering materials whose properties are governed by quantum mechanical effects and are essential for building quantum technologies.

This area underpins **all quantum hardware**, making it one of the most foundational yet least visible pillars of the quantum ecosystem.

## What are quantum materials?

Quantum materials are materials in which quantum effects such as:
- Superconductivity
- Topological order
- Strong electron correlations
- Spin coherence

play a dominant role in determining physical properties.

These materials enable qubits, interconnects, sensors, and control components.

## Why quantum materials matter

Without suitable materials:
- Qubits cannot achieve long coherence times
- Devices cannot scale reliably
- Fabrication yields remain low
- Noise and decoherence dominate

Progress in quantum computing is often limited by materials, not algorithms.
