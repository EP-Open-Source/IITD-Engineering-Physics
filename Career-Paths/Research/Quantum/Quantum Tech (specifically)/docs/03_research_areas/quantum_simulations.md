## What is quantum simulation?

Quantum simulation involves:
- Mapping a target quantum system to a controllable quantum device
- Studying its dynamics, ground states, or properties
- Extracting physical insights not accessible classically

Simulators may be digital (gate-based) or analog.

## Why quantum simulation matters

Many important problems in:
- Condensed matter physics
- Quantum chemistry
- High-energy physics
- Materials science

are computationally intractable on classical computers.

Quantum simulators offer a path to understanding:
- Strongly correlated systems
- Phase transitions
- Molecular energy landscapes
- Exotic quantum states

## Types of quantum simulation

### Digital quantum simulation
- Uses quantum circuits
- Flexible but resource-intensive
- Requires error mitigation or correction

### Analog quantum simulation
- Uses specially engineered quantum systems
- Highly efficient for specific models
- Less programmable

Both approaches are actively researched.
